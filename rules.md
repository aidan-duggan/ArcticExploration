## Setup

Set of cards are dealt to each player.
Some random cards placed in each players offer area.
Each player gets an alotment of money.

## Phases

The game consists of two phases. 

Phase one players move cards from their hand to their storage or purchase cards from other players offerings.

Phase two players race to the arctic using their supplies winner is who gets their the fastest.

_Design Notes:_

_My original idea is to build off Bridge, where the game is actually in the bidding phase, where players bet on who can do the best. Then the card playing part is only half the game. This evolved in players building a stock of items (like the bidding phase) and then racing to the Arctic is more like the card playing part. On reflection this is actaully similar to Galaxy Truckers a game I have yet to get the chance to play. The most important aspect is that phase 2 needs to be fast so that players in a bad position at the end of phase one are not punished too much._

## Turn

Each turn players must add a card to their Storage, placed face down on top of previous items. They can play from their hand or purchase from other players. They can then also place a card from their hand up for sale in their offering section.
